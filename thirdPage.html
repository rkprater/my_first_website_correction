        <ol reversed><h2>10 reasons why I hate Duke!</h2>
            <li>The name Blue Devils</li>
                <p>Not because of the fact that it is anti-religious,
                 but because they are named after a the French fighting
                 batallion "les Diables Bleus", and no one likes the French.
                 This actually proves my point that the hatred of Duke has
                 nothing to do with their success, because the French Army
                 always loses. Go ahead type "French Military Victories" into
                 the Google search and click I'm feeling lucky. It comes up
                 with this page and the Did you mean: French military defeats.
                 We don't hate Duke because they win, we hate them because
                 they are named after the French Military.</p>
              <li>Coach Krzyzewski</li>
                <p>For so many reasons. First of all he looks like a rat, and
                  having to watch him pace the sidelines and whine, complain,
                  and moan while just thinking he's looking for cheese or
                  picturing his head stuck in a mouse-trap. Also Look at his
                  last name, now I don't see how his name is Chi-Chef-ski.
                  His name is Kriz-iz-ooski, doesn't that make more sense.
                  Hey I have a tough last name (Domschke) but when you break
                  it down it sounds like it's spelled Dom-Sch-ke, it's not
                  Tra-lada-daski. Why should the world form to how you want
                  your name pronounced.</p>
                <li>Dick Vitale</li>
                  <p>Not Dick Vitale as a person, because, though he can be a
                    little abrasive at times, he's good at his job. Except when
                    he's doing Duke games, and he always seems like he's doing
                    Duke games. It's one thing to have a gently hidden bias
                    when doing commentary. I can only imagine how hard it would
                    be to do an Arizona game and not be at the very least
                    slightly biased, but then again, I'm not a professional
                    and people don't have to listen to me. Vitale not only is
                    slightly biased he is a half step away from cheering for
                    Duke on the telecast, and not quietly but more like that
                    one friend who won't shut up during a game, rooting for
                    Duke. I half expect him to have blue face paint in the
                    booth.</p>
                  <li>The Cameron Crazies</li>
                    <p>The Cameron Crazies: I am all about rooting for your
                      team, I'm the guy who refuses to sit down, and althouh
                      I'm not personally a fan of the jumping, I'm all for
                      spirit. With that said the Cameron Crazies are
                      ridiculous. As in this SI Article from a couple years
                      ago "Taunts such as 'Safety school!' (toward Wake Forest)
                       and 'We're smart! You're dumb!' (at UNC) that play off
                       Duke's academic standards continue to anger not only
                       opponents but also many among the 4,000-plus students
                       who don't attend games. The condemnation is completely
                       obnoxious. We don't hate you because you're smarter, we
                       hate you because you think you're smarter than you are.
                       Especially since their "Cheer Sheets" were inflitrated
                       by a UNC fan.</p>
                      <li>Cameron Crazies Cheer Sheets</li>
                        <p>Even worse than just their holier than thou attitude
                          are their obnoxious cheers. According to one cheer
                          sheet, "Don't hesitate to uphold the tradition of the
                          Cameron Crazies. There's a reason people all over this
                          fine country hate us, and it's because we're clever,
                          ruthless, and persistent fans. Let's make that
                          especially true this year. Yell loud and stay loud."
                          Clever and pre-printed mass produced cheer sheets
                          seem like complete opposites to me. Their entire
                          game plan is figured out on the sheets, if you refer
                          back to my complaint about the Diamondback fans
                          from October, they have to be told when and what
                          to cheer, it's just sad.</p>
                        <li>Calls</li>
                          <p>They get all the calls for whatever reason the
                            refs are afraid to call anything against Duke.Also,
                             watch their guards on defense they get into
                             position of the ballhandler, good defensive stance,
                              legs shoulder width apart and then give them their
                              best Tim Tebow impression and shove their arm into
                              the guys back. Last time I checked hand checking
                              was illegal, but that's a staple of their defense.
                              Were they grandfathered in or something when they
                              added the rule?</p>
                            <li>Flops</li>
                              <p>To go along with the calls, and as I'm sure you
                                all know the flops. I could post videos of their
                                flops but I don't think blogger has the space
                                available to host them all.It's nothing new,
                                they've been doing it for years, and all I can
                                picture is Coach K with a piece of cheese
                                imitating the great Gordon Bombay telling them
                                to take the fall and act hurt.</p>
                              <li>Media</li>
                                <p>Duke is shoved down our throats whether die-hard
                                   or casual observers of the game from October
                                   through April. There is a media bias the likes
                                    of which have never been seen before, for
                                    some reason everyone, with a microphone,
                                    loves Duke. </p>
                                <li>The Cheap Plays</li>
                                  <p>The Cheap plays: Beyond just the dives and
                                    flops and no calls, Duke is cheap, always
                                     have been. Everytime you see clips of the
                                     rivalry, its always the Carolina player who
                                     has the bloody nose. Duke has a long history
                                     of being cheap, hence why no one likes them.</p>
                                  <li>Besides just being Duke, they cannot develop talent</li>
                                    <p>Now Duke fans will try to tell you that
                                    they have some of the top numbers of players on
                                    rosters in the NBA. That is TRUE. However, when you
                                    look at the number of players who actually start,
                                    contribute more than 5 mpg (minutes per game), they
                                    aren't very good. What's worse about this trend,
                                    it's only been in the past 4-5 years that Duke has
                                    actually had players drafted in mass numbers. When
                                    considering a longer scope of time schools like UNC,
                                    Connecticut, Texas, and Arizona have long been staplepoints
                                    for turning college talent into NBA starters.</p>
                                <ul>PS - as one extra reason to hate Duke,
                                    I wanted to include
                                    that their cheerleadrs have been voted ugliest
                                    cheer squad for 11 years in a row.
                                    </ul>
