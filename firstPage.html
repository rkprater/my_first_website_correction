          <h3>So this is a website <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rkpraterjr">about me</a> and what I like</h3>
            <p>I am from NC originally and have lived in Charleston since August
              2014. Here are some things that I do with my time.
                <ul>
                  <li>Spend time with my fiance</li>
                  <li>Play with Tucker, my dog</li>
                  <li>Catch up on all the sports in my life</li>
                </ul></p>
              <p>My interests in sports are vast and take up most of my spare
              time. I love UNC so much, I have dedicated a whole <a href="thirdPage.html">page</a> to them.
               Here are some of my favorite sports
              <ol>
                  <li>Baseball(College and MLB)</li>
                  <li>Football(CFB and NFL)</li>
